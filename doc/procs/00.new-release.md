Releasing new version
=====================

This procedure must be done before releasing a new irccd version.

1. Switch to the appropriate release branch.

Example, if about to release 2.0.5 :

$ hg update release-2.0

2. Change the version number in the cmake/IrccdVersion.cmake file.

Example:

set(IRCCD_VERSION_MAJOR "3")
set(IRCCD_VERSION_MINOR "5")
set(IRCCD_VERSION_PATCH "8")

3. Update or verify the CHANGES.md file

4. Update the README.md

You must remove the "This is a development version" notice from the file and change the version.

5. For each plugin, update versions

All plugins always have the same version as irccd.

6. Change the version in the irccd guide.

7. Create a new tag x.y.z

8. Push the changes and merge by top-porting it

Example:

$ hg push
$ hg update stable-2
$ hg merge release-2.0
$ hg up default
$ hg merge release-2.0

9. Create the package

$ make release

The alias section can be used to define custom user commands.
.Pp
To define an alias, just add a new section named
.Nm alias.name
where name is your desired alias name.
.Pp
Then, add any option you like to execute commands you want. The option name is
ignored and serves as auto-documentation only.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal
[alias.present]
say-hello = ( "server-message", "localhost", "#staff", "hello world!" )
warning = ( "server-me", "localhost", "#staff", "is a bot")
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm Placeholders
.Pp
Sometimes, you want to pass parameters to your alias. The placeholder syntax
allows you to define where your command line arguments will be replaced before
being sent to irccd.
.Pp
The syntax uses `%n` where **n** is an integer starting from 0.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal
[alias.present]
say-hello = ( "server-message", "%0", "%1", "hello world!" )
warning = ( "server-me", "%0", "%1", "is a bot")

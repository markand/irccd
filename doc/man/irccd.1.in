.It

.Pp
The application runs as daemon and waits for events in both IRC servers
or from the irccdctl(1) utility.
.Pp
For instance, when IRC events happen, it calls JavaScript functions from plugins to
execute specific actions. Example: someone join the channel, the
.Nm irccd
daemon will notify all plugins that a user joined.
.Pp
But it is also possible to use irccdctl(1) to control
.Nm irccd .
For instance, you may want at any time to change the nick of the irccd daemon,
is it possible with one command.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Do not run as a daemon.
.It Fl c Ar config
A path to a config file.

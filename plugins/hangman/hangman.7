.Ed
.\" USAGE
.Sh USAGE
The
.Nm
plugin starts when a user execute its special command with no arguments.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
markand: !hangman
irccd: markand, the game is started, the word to find is: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
.Ed

If a game is already running, the same command shows the current word.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
markand: !hangman
irccd: markand, the game is already running and the word is: s _ _,
.Ed
.Pp
There are two ways for proposing a response to the game. You can either just ask
for a letter or for a whole word.
.Ss By letter
When asking a letter, the message must be one letter.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
markand: c
irccd: markand, nice! the word is now c _ _ _ _
jean: k
irccd: jean, there is no 'k'.
.Ed
.Ss By full word
When asking by a word, just put one word as command argument. Note that in
contrast to the letter proposal we have used command invocation rather than
normal message to avoid possible propositions by mistake.
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
markand: !hangman couch
irccd: markand, this is not the word.
jean: !hangman candy
irccd: jean, congratulations, the word is candy.
